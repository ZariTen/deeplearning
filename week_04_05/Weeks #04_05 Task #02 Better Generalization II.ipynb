Reviewing the line plot of loss during training, we can see that the patience allowed the training to progress past some small at and bad spots.\n","\n","We can also see that test loss started to increase again in the last approximately 100 epochs. This means that although the model's performance has improved, we may not have the\n","best performing or most stable model at the end of training. We can address this by using a **ModelChecckpoint callback**. In this case, we are interested in saving the model with the best accuracy on the test dataset.
