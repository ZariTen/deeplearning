In its simplest definition, procedural programming involves writing code in a number of sequential steps — and sometimes we combine these steps into commands called **functions**.\n","\n","In this chapter, we're going to learn about a new system: **object-oriented programming (OOP)**. Rather than code being designed around sequential steps, it is instead defined around **objects**. For now, you can think of objects as being closely related to variables. We'll learn a more formal definition on the next section.\n","\n",">When working with data, it's much more common to use a style that is closer to procedural programming style than OOP, but it's very important to understand how OOP works, because **Python is an object-oriented language**.\n","\n","This means almost everything in Python is actually an object; when you're working with Python, you are creating and manipulating objects. As you continue to learn to work with data in Python, you'll encounter objects everywhere:\n","\n","  - **NumPy** and **pandas** — the two libraries essential to working with data in Python — both define a number of their own object types.\n","  - **Matplotlib** — which you use to create data visualizations — uses object types to define the charts you create.\n","  - **Scikit-learn** — which you use to create machine learning models — uses object types to represent the models you train and make predictions with.\n","\n","While it's much less common for data scientists and data analysts to define new types of objects, we'll be using objects all the time. Understanding how objects work allows us to better understand what is happening behind the scenes as we work with data.\n","\n","In OOP, objects have types, but instead of \"type\" we use the word **class**. So far, we've been using the word \"type\" to describe different variables:\n","\n","- String type\n","- List type\n","- Dictionary type\n","\n","Technically, the correct name for each of these is:\n","\n","- String class\n","- List class\n","- Dictionary class\n","\n","In everyday English, the word **class** refers to a group of similar things. In OOP, we use the word similarly — a **class** is a type of object.\n","\n","When talking about programming, the words **'type'** and **'class'** are often used interchangeably, but **'class'** is used when talking more formally about objects.

When we define a class, we specify a **parent** class from which it inherits. Inheriting from a class means that the behavior of the parent also exists in the child, but that the child can still define its own additional behavior.\n","\n","Consider a **Player** class with generic information about NBA players. This would be very useful because players have a lot of things in common. However, we may also want to add specific behavior for different positions. We can define classes like **Center**, **Forward**, or **Point Guard**, each with behavior that's specific to that position. These classes would each specify **Player** as its parent class. They would all be siblings -- each would inherit the same behaviors from the **Player** class, while also having special behaviors of their own.\n","\n","In Python 3, every class is a subclass of a generic **object** class. While this happens automatically when we don't specify an ancestor, it's sometimes good practice to be explicit. For the remainder of this chapter, we'll specify when a class has **object** as its parent while we code. This is a good programming practice -- if we get into the habit of specifying a class's ancestry, we won't forget to specify a parent when it's something other than object. It's simply a way to form good habits."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"0VI_5nreDOmd"},"source":["## 2.7 Overloading Inherited Behavior"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"ldUmn8AaDfDL"},"source":["When a class inherits from a parent class, it acquires all of the behavior of that parent class.

The best way to wrap your head around this is through an example.\n","\n","Let's consider the addition operator (+). The **object** class already defines a method for addition. The **sum()** function is defined using this addition method, but the **object** class doesn't really know how to add integers or floating points specifically.\n","\n","However, the integer and float classes define their own addition method (thus overloading the **object's** addition method), and the **sum()** function will add the values together properly.
